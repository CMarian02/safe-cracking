<h1 align = 'center'>Safe Cracking</h1>
<p><b>[❗]</b>As the title makes clear, the project consists of a small puzzle game, in which you are subjected to trying to crack a safe by guessing the combination of numbers.<br>
<b>[❓]</b>How it works?<br>
<b>[✔]</b>The minigame is based on the fact that by turning the dial you will be able to find the key digits to unlock the safe.<br>
<b>[🕹️]</b>How to play?<br>
<b>[✔]</b>Very simply, you have to use the arrows (left arrow or up arrow to move left, and right arrow or down arrow to move right), for ease and to create a way to predict where the key number is, we created a bar to alert the distance to it.<br>
⚪ - if you are between 250 and 360 positions away<br>
🟢 - if you are between 150 and 250 positions away<br>
🟡 - if you are between 50 and 150 positions away<br>
🟠 - if you are between 10 and 50 positions away<br>
🔴 - if you are between 0 and 5 positions away<br>
1️⃣ - In order to break the first number, you have to stay in position for 3 seconds, then a specific noise will be heard.<br>
2️⃣ - In order to break the second number, you have to stay in position for 4 seconds, then a specific noise will be heard.<br>
3️⃣ - In order to crack the third number, and the safe, you have to stay in position for 5 seconds, then a specific noise will be heard.<br>
<b>[🔜]</b> Future implementations in the programme:<br>
<ul>
<li>[⏳] - A timer to increase the difficulty.</li>
<li>[🧠] - Possibility to choose a difficulty</li>
<li>[▶] - New animations when finding the specific number to crack the safe.</li></ul></p>
